<br><br>找不到糖霜了吗
<br><br>Uh-oh. Frosting emergency?
<br><br>你好像有一罐备用糖霜放在药橱里
<br><br>I think you have a back-up can in the medicine cabinet.
<br><br>不 我在找别的东西
<br><br>No, I'm looking for something else.
<br><br>不要说"备用糖霜" 好像我经常需要一样
<br><br>And don't say "Back-up can" Like it's a regular thing.
<br><br>我随时可以戒掉糖霜的
<br><br>I can stop whenever I want.
<br><br>你最近有看到什么东西
<br><br>Hey, have you seen anything around the house recently
<br><br>像是我藏起来的吗
<br><br>that looks like I might have hidden it?
<br><br>给爸爸的生日礼物吗？
<br><br>Ooh, is it for Dad's birthday?
<br><br>不 这件事很重要
<br><br>No, this is for something important.
<br><br>Axl再过几周就毕业了
<br><br>Axl's graduating in a few weeks,
<br><br>但我找不到给他的礼物了
<br><br>and I can't find the present I got him.
<br><br>大概是一年前 我在一家商店
<br><br>I was in a store, like, a year ago,
<br><br>碰到这个东西
<br><br>and I stumbled across this thing...
<br><br>它触动了我 而且特别有寓意
<br><br>it was touching, it was sentimental,
<br><br>简直是完美的礼物
<br><br>it was the perfect gift.
<br><br>－所以是什么礼物？ －我想不起来了
<br><br>- So what is it? - I don't remember.
<br><br>好像是这么大个儿
<br><br>I mean, it was like yea big
<br><br>或者这么大
<br><br>or yea big.
<br><br>我不确定
<br><br>I don't know.
<br><br>我扔到这附近了 但是...
<br><br>I threw it in here somewhere, but I...
<br><br>我的备用饼干
<br><br>ooh, my back-up cookies.
<br><br>别说话
<br><br>Shut up.
<br><br>没事的
<br><br>It's okay.
<br><br>考虑一下我们记得的事情吧
<br><br>So regarding things we can remember,
<br><br>爸爸的生日我们怎么过？
<br><br>what are we doing for Dad's birthday?
<br><br>我不会在这个人身上浪费任何精力的
<br><br>I'm not wasting any energy on that guy.
<br><br>你知道他的生日最没趣了
<br><br>You know he's the least-fun birthday person ever.
<br><br>他不喜欢别人唱生日歌
<br><br>He doesn't want to be sung to.
<br><br>也不想要礼物
<br><br>He doesn't want any presents.
<br><br>我打算把那块在福惠超市停电大甩卖时候
<br><br>I'm just gonna defrost that steak we got cheap
<br><br>买的便宜牛排给他解冻一下做了
<br><br>at the Frugal Hoosier power-outage sale
<br><br>然后让他一个人呆着就好
<br><br>and leave him alone.
<br><br>他会很开心的
<br><br>He'll be happy.
<br><br>我们不能什么都不做
<br><br>Okay, we can't just not do anything.
<br><br>他为了让我能上学 卖掉了他的尿布生意
<br><br>He sold his diaper business so I could go to school.
<br><br>而且人过五十
<br><br>Besides, when you're over 50,
<br><br>必须珍惜每一个生日
<br><br>you have to cherish every birthday.
<br><br>这话是什么意思
<br><br>What's that supposed to mean?
<br><br>-没什么 - 我了解你的意思
<br><br>- Nothing. - I know what it means.
<br><br>帮我想想 我会把东西藏在哪里呢
<br><br>Listen, where would I have hidden something
<br><br>一个我能找到 但是别人找不到的地方？
<br><br>that I know I could find, but nobody else would?
<br><br>地下室?
<br><br>The basement?
<br><br>不 我不会把东西藏在地下室
<br><br>No, I don't hide things in the basement.
<br><br>难道我放了吗?
<br><br>Or do I?
<br><br>不要年过五十
<br><br>Don't turn over 50.
<br><br>嗨 朋友
<br><br>Hey, friend.
<br><br>你好 Dylan
<br><br>Hi, Dylan.
<br><br>你就让我的手悬在这儿吗？
<br><br>You're just gonna leave me hanging?
<br><br>用得着每天都握手吗
<br><br>Do we have to do this every day?
<br><br>我只想去教室
<br><br>I just want to get to class.
<br><br>你在说什么呀
<br><br>What are you talking about?
<br><br>我只是想和我的好伙计打个招呼
<br><br>I'm just trying to greet my pal
<br><br>来一个友善的握手
<br><br>with a friendly handshake.
<br><br>你知道我们不是朋友
<br><br>You know we're not friends.
<br><br>我们当然是朋友 朋友之间要干什么呢
<br><br>Sure, we are. And what do friends do?
<br><br>握手
<br><br>They shake hands.
<br><br>我来和你握手
<br><br>I'll shake your hand.
<br><br>离我男朋友远点
<br><br>Leave my boyfriend alone.
<br><br>你真是个怪胎
<br><br>You're a weirdo.
<br><br>谢谢
<br><br>Thanks.
<br><br>走吧 Brick
<br><br>Let's go, Brick.
<br><br>我来帮你拿
<br><br>Let me get that for you.
<br><br>你在这儿呀
<br><br>Ah, there you are.
<br><br>听好了
<br><br>Okay, listen.
<br><br>我在为老爸的生日做视频
<br><br>I'm making a video for Dad's birthday.
<br><br>想象一下 他最亲近和亲爱的人们
<br><br>Picture this... his nearest and dearest
<br><br>口述一些温暖的回忆和趣事
<br><br>recounting fond memories and funny stories
<br><br>然后编辑成一个纪念品
<br><br>all edited together into a cherished keepsake
<br><br>这个视频他可以看一辈子
<br><br>he can watch for the rest of his life.
<br><br>我还没开始做
<br><br>I haven't even made it yet,
<br><br>但我已经等不及要送给他了
<br><br>and I can't wait to give it to him.
<br><br>他会喜欢的
<br><br>Oh, he'll love it.
<br><br>你还记得你5岁的时候
<br><br>Okay, do you remember when you were 5
<br><br>想给自己化妆
<br><br>and you wanted to wear makeup
<br><br>用永久马克笔涂花了自己的眼睛吗
<br><br>so you colored in your eyelid with permanent marker?
<br><br>那个想法都比这个好100倍
<br><br>That idea was 100 times better than this one.
<br><br>所以你要给他什么好东西呢
<br><br>Okay, well, what are you gonna get him that's so great?
<br><br>什么都不给
<br><br>I'm not getting him anything.
<br><br>我存在的每一天都是给他的礼物
<br><br>Every day, I give him the gift
<br><br>毕竟我是唯一一个把他的遗传基因发扬光大的
<br><br>of being the only positive reflection of his DNA.
<br><br>我要做这个视频
<br><br>Okay, look, I'm doing this,
<br><br>所以明天3点你要准备好上镜
<br><br>so I need you to be camera-ready tomorrow at 3:00.
<br><br>预习一下问题
<br><br>Study the questions.
<br><br>我不想听到任何"呃" "啊" "随便吧"这种词
<br><br>I don't want to hear any "Uhs" Or "Ums" Or "Whatevers."
<br><br>"如果爸爸是动物，他会是什么动物?"
<br><br>"If Dad was an animal, which one would he be?"
<br><br>"我更喜欢爸爸的哪件格子衬衫
<br><br>"Which one of Dad's plaid shirts is my favorite,
<br><br>深蓝色还是浅蓝色?”
<br><br>the dark blue or the light blue?"
<br><br>我觉得至少要有一个好玩的问题
<br><br>Yeah, I wanted to have at least one funny question.
<br><br>一点都不好玩
<br><br>Well, you didn't.
<br><br>什么?
<br><br>Uh, what?
<br><br>你咋了?
<br><br>What's with you?
<br><br>没什么
<br><br>Nothing.
<br><br>聊天愉快
<br><br>Good talk.
<br><br>好吧 被你发现了
<br><br>All right, you dragged it out of me.
<br><br>是跟Cindy有关的事情
<br><br>It's something to do with Cindy.
<br><br>怎么 你亲她用的梯子丢了吗
<br><br>What? Did you lose the stepladder you use to kiss her?
<br><br>搞笑
<br><br>Funny.
<br><br>其实我一直觉得自己是个现代人
<br><br>You know, I've always considered myself a modern man.
<br><br>我相信女性的权力也是人权
<br><br>I believe women's rights are human rights, but...
<br><br>但是今天我被欺负了
<br><br>...today I was getting bullied.
<br><br>你被人欺负了？
<br><br>You were getting bullied?
<br><br>你没事吧？
<br><br>Are you okay?
<br><br>需要我介入教训一下那个人吗
<br><br>Do I need to step in and talk some sense into this guy?
<br><br>不用
<br><br>No.
<br><br>Cindy把他赶走了
<br><br>Cindy chased him away.
<br><br>- 哇哦 - 是啊
<br><br>- Whoa. - I know.
<br><br>相比于女朋友帮我出头
<br><br>Being bullied didn't bother me so much
<br><br>被欺负反而没有太让我觉得怎么样
<br><br>as having my girlfriend stick up for me.
<br><br>让我更困扰的是她帮我出头
<br><br>It made me feel... less than
<br><br>因为Cindy是个女孩
<br><br>'cause Cindy's a girl,
<br><br>虽然不应该这么想
<br><br>but it shouldn't have.
<br><br>不 绝对应该这么想
<br><br>No, it definitely should have.
<br><br>真的很丢人
<br><br>That is super embarrassing.
<br><br>快告诉我没有人围观
<br><br>Just tell me it wasn't in front of people
<br><br>而且没人知道你是Heck家的人
<br><br>and they don't know you're a Heck.
<br><br>我倒是可以这么说
<br><br>I mean, I could tell you that.
<br><br>我也不知道
<br><br>I don't know.
<br><br>以前这些事从没困扰过我
<br><br>In the past, it's never bothered me
<br><br>在50码冲刺中
<br><br>to be the kid who has to take a water break
<br><br>需要中途休息喝口水
<br><br>during the 50-yard dash
<br><br>或者在午餐的时候剥不开香蕉
<br><br>or the guy at lunch who can't open his own banana,
<br><br>但是我无法接受
<br><br>but I'm having trouble accepting the fact
<br><br>我女朋友比我更强壮的事实
<br><br>that my girlfriend is stronger than me.
<br><br>我也不知道该怎么面对
<br><br>And I don't know what to do about it.
<br><br>也许我应该长点肌肉
<br><br>I'm thinking I might need to get
<br><br>像书里写的那样
<br><br>some of those muscles I've read about.
<br><br>那很巧 我可以帮你
<br><br>Mm. Well, it just so happens, I can help you with that.
<br><br>- 真的吗 - 对啊
<br><br>- Really? - Mm-hmm.
<br><br>让我来快速改造你
<br><br>I'll whip you into shape in no time.
<br><br>我们先测量一下你现在是什么水平
<br><br>We just got to gauge your starting point,
<br><br>给你拿个香蕉试试
<br><br>so, uh, let's get a banana in here.
<br><br>讲真 我们应该拿一个香蕉
<br><br>But seriously, we should get a banana.
<br><br>妈 你还好吗
<br><br>Mom, are you okay?
<br><br>嘘
<br><br>Shh.
<br><br>我在努力回想
<br><br>I'm trying to picture
<br><br>最后看到Axl礼物的地方
<br><br>the last place I saw Axl's present.
<br><br>和礼物到底是什么
<br><br>And also what it was.
<br><br>好的 那你收到我的邮件了吗
<br><br>Okay, but did you get my e-mail?
<br><br>标题写的是
<br><br>The subject line was,
<br><br>"重大机密-不要在老爸面前打开"
<br><br>"Super Top Secret Do Not Open in Front of Dad."
<br><br>不是所有你发的邮件我都会看的 Sue
<br><br>I don't read all your e-mails, Sue.
<br><br>你总是给我发好多邮件
<br><br>You e-mail me a lot.
<br><br>你得在明天拍摄之前
<br><br>Well, I need you to read over these questions
<br><br>- 看看这些问题啊 - 拍摄
<br><br>- before I film you tomorrow. - Film me?
<br><br>等等 你到底要做什么
<br><br>Wait, what exactly are you doing?
<br><br>我以为你给他做一个
<br><br>I thought you were making him
<br><br>发光的卡片或者是发光饼干
<br><br>a glitter card or glitter cookies.
<br><br>- 你做发光的东西还蛮擅长的 - 不是
<br><br>- You're so good with glitter. - No.
<br><br>我要给爸爸做一个
<br><br>I'm making him a video
<br><br>大家都说他好的视频
<br><br>of people saying nice things about Dad.
<br><br>Sue 他不会喜欢的
<br><br>Oh, Sue, he's gonna hate that.
<br><br>怎么会呢 他肯定会喜欢的
<br><br>What? No, he's gonna love it.
<br><br>我知道他表面看起来很强硬
<br><br>I know he acts like a tough guy,
<br><br>但是他内心很柔软的
<br><br>but he's got the squooshiest center.
<br><br>你没见过他看海洋奇缘的样子 我看到了
<br><br>You didn't see him at "Moana." I did.
<br><br>我认识你爸爸已经20多年了
<br><br>Look, I've known your dad for over 20 years.
<br><br>他可不是柔软的人
<br><br>There's no squoosh in there.
<br><br>他看了这个视频之后
<br><br>Well, there is definitely gonna be some softening
<br><br>肯定会变柔软
<br><br>after this video.
<br><br>相信我
<br><br>I can promise you that.
<br><br>好了 你需要先看一下这些问题
<br><br>Now, I need you to read over these questions.
<br><br>我可就靠你
<br><br>I am counting on you
<br><br>来煽情了
<br><br>for all the emotional tender stuff.
<br><br>我连自己买的礼物都找不到了
<br><br>I can't even find the present.
<br><br>怎么可能回忆起以前为什么会爱你们老爸
<br><br>How am I supposed to remember why I used to love your dad?
<br><br>好的 你需要的东西都在这了
<br><br>Okay, got everything you need right here...
<br><br>卧推 弯举 深蹲
<br><br>bench, curls, squats.
<br><br>但 第一项练习
<br><br>But our first exercise...
<br><br>是扔掉笔记本
<br><br>...notebook toss.
<br><br>Brick 你不要写
<br><br>Brick, you don't got to be writing it.
<br><br>要做
<br><br>We're gonna be doing it.
<br><br>我以为做之前要先学习一下
<br><br>I thought there was gonna be a learning portion first.
<br><br>我不想逞英雄
<br><br>I don't need to be a hero.
<br><br>不用担心
<br><br>There's no danger of that.
<br><br>来 我先给你演示一下你的目标
<br><br>Now, let me show you what you're aiming for here.
<br><br>有点生疏了
<br><br>Must be a little rusty.
<br><br>最近没锻炼
<br><br>I haven't been training.
<br><br>赛季结束以后我都没怎么锻炼
<br><br>I kind of shut the gun show down after football ended.
<br><br>哦 不
<br><br>Oh, no.
<br><br>我的天
<br><br>Oh, God.
<br><br>地板是不是不平啊
<br><br>I don't think this floor is level.
<br><br>注意我的身体是保持直线的
<br><br>Notice how straight I'm keeping my body.
<br><br>双臂保持平衡
<br><br>Arms parallel.
<br><br>一直 保持...
<br><br>Always... maintain...
<br><br>正确的姿势
<br><br>...proper form.
<br><br>等会我会捡起来的
<br><br>I'll pick those up.
<br><br>那么
<br><br>So...
<br><br>我要做多少个呢
<br><br>how many of those should I do?
<br><br>我记得那次爸爸带我去打网球
<br><br>I remember the time Dad took me to play tennis.
<br><br>我我带了书过去 结果他生气了
<br><br>He got mad 'cause I brought my books,
<br><br>气得他脖子上的青筋暴起
<br><br>which the veins in his neck start popping out, but...
<br><br>停
<br><br>Cut.
<br><br>Brick 我需要的是美好的回忆
<br><br>Brick, these are supposed to be nice memories.
<br><br>这就是美好的回忆啊
<br><br>Uh, that is a nice memory.
<br><br>爸爸和我不怎么在一起的
<br><br>Dad and I don't do a lot together.
<br><br>好吧 但听起来不怎么好
<br><br>Okay, well, it doesn't sound so nice.
<br><br>我需要的是发自内心真诚的美好 快点想想
<br><br>Now I want heartfelt, so step it up.
<br><br>让我感受到感情
<br><br>Okay, make me feel something.
<br><br>开始
<br><br>And... action.
<br><br>这是关于爸爸的一件趣事
<br><br>Here's a fond memory with Dad...
<br><br>就是他教我开车的那次
<br><br>the time he tried to teach me how to drive.
<br><br>那次他脖子上的青筋真的是暴起
<br><br>The veins were really popping out of his neck then.
<br><br>Brick 不要总说他的青筋
<br><br>Brick, stop talking about veins.
<br><br>好吧 对不起
<br><br>Oh, all right, fine. Sorry.
<br><br>我想想
<br><br>Um, let's see.
<br><br>我对爸爸最好的回忆
<br><br>Well, one of my best times with Dad
<br><br>就是他让我扫叶子的那次
<br><br>was when he had me rake leaves.
<br><br>很有趣 因为那个时候我才9岁
<br><br>It was funny 'cause I was probably 9 at the time,
<br><br>我担心叶子被会燃烧起火
<br><br>and I was worried about the leaves being incinerated...
<br><br>停
<br><br>Cut.
<br><br>妈妈 我好不容易录到Brick说几句好话
<br><br>Mom, I was finally getting something good out of Brick,
<br><br>结果你入镜了
<br><br>and you're ruining my shot.
<br><br>我马上就能找到了
<br><br>I am so close.
<br><br>你可以在任何地方拍你爸爸的礼物啊
<br><br>You can film Dad's thing anywhere.
<br><br>我不想破坏这个惊喜
<br><br>I don't want to spoil the surprise.
<br><br>这可是个秘密
<br><br>It's a secret.
<br><br>我知道一个公开的秘密
<br><br>Here's something that's not a secret.
<br><br>爸爸不会喜欢这个视频的
<br><br>Dad's gonna hate this video.
<br><br>好吧 如果是别人做的 他可能不会喜欢
<br><br>Okay, from other people, he might hate it,
<br><br>但我做的不会
<br><br>but not from me.
<br><br>好了 Mom 你能走出我的镜头了吗
<br><br>Now, Mom, will you please get out of my shot?
<br><br>Brick好不容易讲了一个没有青筋的故事
<br><br>I finally had a vein-free story from Brick,
<br><br>还被你给破坏了
<br><br>and you screwed it up.
<br><br>其实不是
<br><br>That's actually not true.
<br><br>故事的结尾会呼应 提到他的青筋
<br><br>The end of the story comes around nicely back to veins.
<br><br>- Brick - 太好了
<br><br>- Brick. - Yes!
<br><br>就是这个
<br><br>This is it.
<br><br>我想起来了
<br><br>Now I remember.
<br><br>我在甜甜圈店
<br><br>I was at the doughnut shop,
<br><br>隔壁的店铺Giftery礼品店 刚刚开张
<br><br>and this new store, The Giftery, had opened next door.
<br><br>我就过去打发时间
<br><br>I was in there killing time,
<br><br>然后我看到了这个堪称完美的
<br><br>when I came across this absolutely perfect...
<br><br>鞋拔子
<br><br>Shoe horn?
<br><br>不不不 这可不是一般的鞋拔子
<br><br>No, no, no, it's not just a shoe horn.
<br><br>这是 商务人士奢华鞋具
<br><br>It's the "Busy Businessman's Luxury Shoe Care Kit."
<br><br>明白了吗
<br><br>Oh, yeah, get it?
<br><br>因为Axl是学商科的
<br><br>'Cause Axl's a business major.
<br><br>我记得当时我觉得这个东西等他找到工作时
<br><br>I remember thinking this would be symbolic
<br><br>是有象征意义的
<br><br>for when he gets a job.
<br><br>我是说 这一套里面还有鞋油 鞋刷
<br><br>I mean, it's got polish and a little applicator,
<br><br>装在这小盒子里 还方便携带
<br><br>and it comes in this handy carrying case.
<br><br>是啊 烂透了
<br><br>Yeah, this sucks.
<br><br>糟了
<br><br>Ugh, crap.
<br><br>现在我要给他送些别的礼物了
<br><br>Now I got to get him something else.
<br><br>好在我在很早以前给他做了个可爱的卡片
<br><br>Oh, well, at least I got him a cute card a while ago.
<br><br>好
<br><br>Okay.
<br><br>所以我们按照Mike喜欢的方式
<br><br>So we celebrated Mike's birthday
<br><br>庆祝了他的生日
<br><br>just the way he wanted...
<br><br>我解冻了一块牛排
<br><br>I defrosted a steak,
<br><br>他在饭桌上看了体育画报
<br><br>and he got to read Sports Illustrated at the table
<br><br>我们其他人都不能说话
<br><br>while the rest of us didn't talk.
<br><br>好的
<br><br>Okay.
<br><br>你可以说话了
<br><br>You can speak.
<br><br>生日快乐爸爸
<br><br>Happy birthday, Dad.
<br><br>- 好的 -等等
<br><br>- All righty. - Wait, wait, wait.
<br><br>我给你准备了一份礼物
<br><br>I got you a present.
<br><br>礼物吗 为什么
<br><br>You did? What for?
<br><br>我告诉你了我什么都不要
<br><br>I told you I didn't want anything.
<br><br>所以我什么都没给你准备
<br><br>And that's why I didn't get you anything.
<br><br>别客气 老爸
<br><br>You're welcome, Dad.
<br><br>父亲节我也会忘掉的
<br><br>Consider Father's Day forgotten, too.
<br><br>真是我的好儿子
<br><br>You're a good son.
<br><br>你真的打算跟我对着干吗
<br><br>Are you seriously gonna argue with me?
<br><br>你就拿着吧 你这个派对破坏者
<br><br>Just take it, you big party pooper.
<br><br>生日快乐
<br><br>Happy birthday.
<br><br>好吧
<br><br>Okay.
<br><br>这是礼物
<br><br>It is a gift.
<br><br>你要把它打开
<br><br>You open it.
<br><br>商务人士奢华鞋具
<br><br>The "Busy Business Man's Luxury Shoe Care Kit."
<br><br>烂透了
<br><br>Ha! That sucks.
<br><br>我喜欢
<br><br>I love it.
<br><br>你还留着收据吗
<br><br>Did you keep the receipt?
<br><br>等下 等等
<br><br>No, wait, wait, wait.
<br><br>我还没给你礼物呢
<br><br>I haven't given you my gift yet.
<br><br>但是我的礼物是打不开的
<br><br>But mine isn't something that can be opened.
<br><br>是需要体验的
<br><br>It must be experienced.
<br><br>所以请大家
<br><br>So if you would all be so kind
<br><br>移步到客厅
<br><br>as to follow me to the family room.

<br><br>Sue Sue Heck影业荣誉出品…
<br><br>Sue Sue Heck Productions proudly presents...
<br><br>晚上好 我是Sue Heck
<br><br>Good evening. I'm Sue Heck.
<br><br>这是Michael Heck的庆祝会
<br><br>And this is a celebration of Michael Heck.
<br><br>一切都从1963年开始
<br><br>It all began here in 1963,
<br><br>那一年
<br><br>the year this wonderful man,
<br><br>这个对全世界都意义非凡的好男人
<br><br>a man who means so much to the world,
<br><br>出生了
<br><br>was born.
<br><br>我找不到你婴儿时的照片
<br><br>I couldn't find a baby picture of you.
<br><br>那么是什么造就了伟大的他呢?
<br><br>So what makes a man great?
<br><br>让我们一起寻找答案吧
<br><br>Let's find out, shall we?
<br><br>我喜欢Mike什么?
<br><br>What do I love about Mike?
<br><br>很明显 我爱他因为我嫁给了他
<br><br>Uh, well, obviously, I love him 'cause I married him.
<br><br>还有什么呢?
<br><br>And, um, what else?
<br><br>他是个维持家庭生计的人
<br><br>Well, he's a great provider.
<br><br>可以说他是我坚强的后盾
<br><br>Yeah, I would say he's my rock.
<br><br>大A(Axl)祝大M(Mike)生日快乐
<br><br>Happy B to the Big M from the Big A.
<br><br>等等 这听起来太奇怪了 能重新来吗?
<br><br>Wait, that sounds bathroom-y. Can I start over?
<br><br>老爸最酷的事
<br><br>The cool about thing about Dad
<br><br>是无论他的头发是湿的还是干的 看起来都一样
<br><br>is his hair looks the same wet or dry.
<br><br>他是...我的后盾
<br><br>He's... my rock.
<br><br>我已经说过了吗?
<br><br>Oh, I said that already?
<br><br>唉
<br><br>Pbht.
<br><br>如果老爸是一种调料
<br><br>Uh, if Dad were a spice,
<br><br>我觉得他是盐
<br><br>uh, I'd say he's salt.
<br><br>老香料(宝洁旗下男士品牌)
<br><br>Old Spice.
<br><br>啤酒算调料吗?
<br><br>Is beer a spice?
<br><br>如果算的话 我觉得是啤酒
<br><br>'Cause, if so, I'd say beer.
<br><br>如果家里没了啤酒
<br><br>When there's no beer in the house,
<br><br>他就会变得很紧绷 还有血管...
<br><br>he gets tense, and this vein...
<br><br>Mike 我都不知道你的生日快到了
<br><br>Mike, I didn't know it was your birthday.
<br><br>你浑身上下都是秘密 是吧?
<br><br>You're just full of secrets, aren't you?
<br><br>等等 这里不只是家人
<br><br>Wait. This isn't just family.
<br><br>是的 不只有家里人
<br><br>Nope.
<br><br>我们要请你过来吃晚餐
<br><br>Well, we're gonna have to have you over for dinner.
<br><br>你什么时候有空?
<br><br>When's good for you?
<br><br>这个周二如何?
<br><br>How's this Tuesday?
<br><br>Ron! Mike这周二过来吃晚餐
<br><br>Ron! Mike's coming over for dinner on Tuesday.
<br><br>用三个词形容Mike?
<br><br>Three words that describe Mike?
<br><br>只有三个? 天啊 这太难了
<br><br>Only three? Oh, gosh, that's hard.
<br><br>英雄 绅士的大个子...
<br><br>Hero, gentle giant...
<br><br>糟了 已经三个了
<br><br>shoot, that's already three.
<br><br>我能再说一个吗?
<br><br>Can I have one more?
<br><br>哪一个Mike? 我知道五个Mike
<br><br>Which Mike? I got five Mikes.
<br><br>你去找了我的理发师?
<br><br>You talked to my barber?
<br><br>对
<br><br>Yeah.
<br><br>高个子Mike... 他来的时候
<br><br>Tall Mike... got to put the chair
<br><br>就要把椅子调到最低
<br><br>all the way down when he comes in.
<br><br>如果Mike是一个冰淇淋口味
<br><br>If Mike were a flavor of ice cream,
<br><br>他会是...香草味
<br><br>he'd be... vanilla.
<br><br>香草味
<br><br>Vanilla.
<br><br>香草 很明显
<br><br>Vanilla, clearly.
<br><br>香草
<br><br>Vanilla.
<br><br>香草
<br><br>Vanilla.
<br><br>妥妥的香草!
<br><br>Show me vanilla!
<br><br>我是在公司总部上班的
<br><br>Uh, I'm based in the corporate office,
<br><br>所以我不太了解Mike Heck
<br><br>so I don't really know Mike Heck that well,
<br><br>因此让我分享我最喜欢的"Mike时刻"
<br><br>which kind of makes it hard for me
<br><br>可能会有些难度
<br><br>to share my favorite, uh, "Mike moment."
<br><br>Sue 他是我的上司
<br><br>Sue, that's my boss.
<br><br>惊喜吧
<br><br>Surprise.
<br><br>我最喜欢的Mike时刻是
<br><br>My favorite Mike moment is,
<br><br>有时 当他下车的时候
<br><br>sometimes, when he's getting out of his car,
<br><br>他会假装没有听到
<br><br>he pretends like he doesn't hear me
<br><br>我在院子里喊他
<br><br>calling from my yard,
<br><br>然后他就自然地走进房子里
<br><br>and he just walks into his house.
<br><br>太逗了
<br><br>Hilarious.
<br><br>我有太多的Mike时刻了 太难选择了
<br><br>I have so many Mike moments, it's hard to pick.
<br><br>可能很多人都不知道
<br><br>Well, not a lot of people know this,
<br><br>Mike非常喜欢猫
<br><br>but Mike loves cats.
<br><br>有一次 我休息的时候来到活动屋
<br><br>One time, I came into the trailer on a break,
<br><br>看到Mike
<br><br>and Mike was watching this video
<br><br>在看猫咪和小兔子玩耍的视频
<br><br>of kittens befriending a bunny rabbit.
<br><br>好了 到此为止吧
<br><br>Okay, that's enough.
<br><br>我领会它的要点了
<br><br>I get the gist.
<br><br>等等 等等 不 不 不
<br><br>Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
<br><br>还有将近15分钟的视频呢
<br><br>Uh, there's, like, 15 more minutes left.
<br><br>Brad作了一首很特别的诗
<br><br>Brad does a special poem,
<br><br>还有福惠超市的装袋工
<br><br>and the bagger at Frugal Hoosier
<br><br>讲了个特别逗的笑话
<br><br>had a really funny story.
<br><br>你还没看到呢
<br><br>You're gonna miss it.
<br><br>算了吧
<br><br>Yeah, well.
<br><br>给你
<br><br>Here you go.
<br><br>你想让我把这个怎么办?
<br><br>What do you want me to do with this?
<br><br>现在鞋具套装看起来更胜一筹了
<br><br>Well, the shoe kit's looking better.
<br><br>你怎么回事?
<br><br>What is the matter with you?
<br><br>我很抱歉
<br><br>I'm sorry.
<br><br>我只是不喜欢别人过于关注我
<br><br>I just don't like people making a big deal over me
<br><br>谈论我或者是评论我
<br><br>or talking about me or thinking about me.
<br><br>这回我得找一个新的理发师
<br><br>Now I got to get a new barber,
<br><br>我本来也挺喜欢这个的
<br><br>and I liked this guy, too.
<br><br>我刚刚让他开始不再和我聊天
<br><br>I'd just gotten him to stop making small talk.
<br><br>行 我知道我嫁给了一个
<br><br>Okay, I know I'm married to a man
<br><br>不善于体会情感的花园小矮人
<br><br>with the emotional capacity of a garden gnome,
<br><br>所以我已经习惯了失望
<br><br>so I'm used to the disappointment.
<br><br>但是Sue没有
<br><br>But Sue isn't.
<br><br>她很受伤
<br><br>She's really hurting.
<br><br>她看起来没怎么失望
<br><br>Ah, she didn't look that upset.
<br><br>因为她看在你的面子上
<br><br>Because she was pretending everything was okay
<br><br>在假装一切安好
<br><br>for your sake,
<br><br>而这些应该是你为她做的
<br><br>which is what you should have been doing for her.
<br><br>你太小题大做了 她没事
<br><br>Oh, you're just being dramatic. She's fine.
<br><br>我想说明一点 那个猫咪视频...
<br><br>And just to be clear, that kitten video...
<br><br>只是我在搜花岗岩价格的时候
<br><br>that just popped up
<br><br>跳出来的广告
<br><br>when I was researching granite prices,
<br><br>所以就别和别人说了
<br><br>so we're not gonna go sharing that with anybody.
<br><br>Mike很确定Sue没事
<br><br>So Mike was positive that Sue was fine,
<br><br>但想了一会儿后...
<br><br>but after having a little time to think it over...
<br><br>Sue
<br><br>Sue.
<br><br>啊?
<br><br>Yeah?
<br><br>对不起
<br><br>Sorry.
<br><br>知道了
<br><br>Okay.
<br><br>你在干啥?
<br><br>What are you doing?
<br><br>没什么 就是欣赏一下
<br><br>Nothing, nothing. Just admiring the view.
<br><br>锻炼的怎么样了?
<br><br>How are those workouts coming?
<br><br>我知道我需要保持体型
<br><br>Well, I know I need to get in shape,
<br><br>所以我做了一件适合我的事
<br><br>so I did the only thing that made sense to me.
<br><br>我去了图书馆 然后看了一本书
<br><br>I went to the library and checked out a book.
<br><br>杰克·拉兰内(美国健身运动员)写的《永远年轻》
<br><br>Jack Lalanne's "Live Young Forever."
<br><br>- 哦 那他现在怎么样了? - 他死了
<br><br>- Oh, okay. What's he doing now? - He's dead.
<br><br>但在这之前 他真的很酷
<br><br>But before that, he was really cool.
<br><br>他可以举起各种重的东西
<br><br>He could lift all these heavy things.
<br><br>有一次他拉动了70条船
<br><br>He once pulled 70 boats.
<br><br>我的目标是15条
<br><br>My goal is 15.
<br><br>那应该足够让Cindy对我刮目相看了
<br><br>That should be enough to impress Cindy.
<br><br>听着 Brick 你不需要书
<br><br>Look, Brick, you don't need a book.
<br><br>你有我做你的教练
<br><br>You got me as your trainer.
<br><br>无意冒犯 Axl
<br><br>No offense, Axl,
<br><br>但是在车库里 事情进展的并不顺利
<br><br>but things weren't really going that well in the garage.
<br><br>已经过了两天了
<br><br>It's been two days,
<br><br>我觉得我的肌肉反而好像减少了
<br><br>and I think I might have actually lost muscle mass.
<br><br>那些都只是运动计划的一部分
<br><br>That's just all part of the workout program
<br><br>我为了你而私人订制的计划
<br><br>I've created specifically for your body.
<br><br>你现在就像一堆土
<br><br>Right now you're like a lump of clay,
<br><br>但是给我些时间
<br><br>but you give me some time,
<br><br>我会把你塑造成艺术品
<br><br>I'm gonna mold you into a work of fine art.
<br><br>就像是大卫雕像
<br><br>It's like the statue of David.
<br><br>你以为米开和朗基罗(本应是米开朗基罗)一晚上就完成了那个雕像吗?
<br><br>You think Michael and Angelo sculpted that thing overnight?
<br><br>并不是
<br><br>No.
<br><br>花了他们俩好多年时间
<br><br>Took those guys years.
<br><br>呃...
<br><br>Yeah...
<br><br>我只是觉得一个体力在衰退的人
<br><br>I just don't think someone who's on the decline physically
<br><br>不应该来教我吧
<br><br>should be teaching me.
<br><br>哇哦 哇哦 哇哦
<br><br>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
<br><br>衰退?
<br><br>Decline?
<br><br>衰... 啥...?
<br><br>Decli... wha...?
<br><br>谁说我在衰退了? 我没有
<br><br>Who said I'm declining? I'm not declining.
<br><br>没事 这很正常
<br><br>Look, it's perfectly natural.
<br><br>经过我的研究
<br><br>In my research,
<br><br>我发现男人在二十五岁到达身体的巅峰期
<br><br>I found that men hit their physical peak at age 25,
<br><br>然后慢慢地下降
<br><br>then slowly decline.
<br><br>你只是比正常的生理现象快一点
<br><br>You're just a little ahead of schedule.
<br><br>从现在起
<br><br>From here on out,
<br><br>你差不多要肌肉退化了
<br><br>you're pretty much just gonna atrophy.
<br><br>我拿过很多奖 Brick
<br><br>Got enough trophies, Brick.
<br><br>确实 可能我有点放纵自己了
<br><br>And, yeah, maybe I let myself go a little bit,
<br><br>但我只要几个俯卧撑就好了
<br><br>but I just got to do a few pushups,
<br><br>我身材立马就会恢复
<br><br>I'll be back in shape like that.
<br><br>噢 抽筋了
<br><br>Ow, cramp.
<br><br>起来
<br><br>Come on.
<br><br>要去哪里?
<br><br>Where are we going?
<br><br>吃冰淇淋 走吧
<br><br>Ice cream. Let's go.
<br><br>不了 谢谢
<br><br>No, thanks.
<br><br>我请客
<br><br>My treat.
<br><br>你会喜欢那儿的
<br><br>You're gonna want to be there.
<br><br>除了香草味的 我还要点些别的
<br><br>I'm thinking of ordering something besides vanilla.
<br><br>算了 我不饿
<br><br>It's all right. I'm not hungry.
<br><br>第二天 Axl还在为Brick的话闹心
<br><br>The next day, Axl was still bugged by what Brick said.
<br><br>如果杰克·拉兰内可以拉动七十艘船
<br><br>I mean, if Jack Lalanne could pull 70 boats,
<br><br>他肯定也能拉动些什么
<br><br>surely there's something he could do.
<br><br>你是个男人 你是个男人
<br><br>You're a man. You're a man.
<br><br>你是个魁梧又强壮的男人
<br><br>You're a big, strong man.
<br><br>我不想说这件事 Brick
<br><br>I don't want to talk about it, Brick.
<br><br>我们永远不要再提起这件事
<br><br>We're never mentioning this ever again.
<br><br>别告诉别人
<br><br>No one needs to know
<br><br>我只把房车拉动了两英尺的距离
<br><br>I only moved the 'Bago two feet.
<br><br>你都没拉动它
<br><br>You didn't move it at all.
<br><br>你真刻薄
<br><br>You're mean.
<br><br>这不公平
<br><br>This isn't fair.
<br><br>以前 如果我觉得弱
<br><br>Used to be, I was feeling weak,
<br><br>只需要来几组俯卧撑 然后就有力量了
<br><br>I'd just do a couple of pushups and get my strength right back,
<br><br>可是 我的天啊 我是怎么了?
<br><br>but, my God, what is happening to me?
<br><br>你觉得是不是因为我谷物圈三明治吃多了?
<br><br>You think it was all those Froot Loop sandwiches?
<br><br>噢我的天哪
<br><br>Oh, God.
<br><br>谷物圈三明治
<br><br>Froot Loop sandwiches.
<br><br>别盯着我的大屁股
<br><br>Don't look at my big butt.
<br><br>Axl 控制住你自己
<br><br>Axl, get a hold of yourself.
<br><br>我的女朋友救了我
<br><br>I got rescued by my girlfriend,
<br><br>但你这个样子比我还尴尬
<br><br>and even I'm embarrassed for you.
<br><br>可是我要毕业了
<br><br>Look, I'm about to graduate.
<br><br>很快 我就要整天坐在办公桌前
<br><br>Pretty soon, I'm gonna be sitting at a desk all day
<br><br>做一些我必须干的活
<br><br>doing whatever it is I'm supposed to be doing,
<br><br>然后我就会衰退
<br><br>and I'm just gonna decay.
<br><br>我马上就要变得跟爸妈一样了
<br><br>I am one step closer to becoming Mom and Dad.
<br><br>嘿 在这过程中至少还有一线希望呀
<br><br>Hey, there's a silver lining in this.
<br><br>没错 男人在二十多岁到达身体的巅峰期
<br><br>Yes, men peak physically in their mid-20s,
<br><br>但是他们的智力巅峰持续到三十五岁呀
<br><br>but they don't peak mentally till age 35.
<br><br>你还在上升
<br><br>You're still in the upswing.
<br><br>智力方面一直不是我的强项
<br><br>Mental's never really been my strong suit.
<br><br>刚好我能帮助你
<br><br>Well, it just so happens I can help you with that.
<br><br>- 真的吗? - 没错
<br><br>- Really? - Yep.
<br><br>等我给你培训完
<br><br>By the time I'm done with you,
<br><br>你的大脑会撕裂的
<br><br>your brain is gonna be ripped.
<br><br>现在 我们从公共广播公司开始
<br><br>Now, let's start with PBS.
<br><br>这会很难的
<br><br>This is gonna be so hard.
<br><br>你得用心去做
<br><br>Got to put in the work.
<br><br>哦 对了
<br><br>Oh, and by the way,
<br><br>米开和朗基罗... 是同一个人
<br><br>Michael and Angelo... one guy.
<br><br>什么?
<br><br>What?
<br><br>我希望你会喜欢 我开车送你回学校
<br><br>I hope it's okay I'm driving you back to school.
<br><br>本来你妈想开车送你的 但是她太忙了
<br><br>Mom was gonna, but she's busy,
<br><br>而我又没什么事情做
<br><br>and I got nothing going on.
<br><br>没事
<br><br>It's fine.
<br><br>谢谢
<br><br>Thank you.
<br><br>什么?
<br><br>What?
<br><br>就是... 谢谢你做的视频
<br><br>You know, for the, uh, whole video thing.
<br><br>做的不错
<br><br>That was nice.
<br><br>好的
<br><br>Okay.
<br><br>我不懂
<br><br>I don't get it.
<br><br>我说了"谢谢" 又说了"对不起"
<br><br>I said, "Thank you," I said, "I'm sorry,"
<br><br>还说了"冰淇淋"
<br><br>I said, "Ice cream,"
<br><br>但好像都没什么用
<br><br>and nothing's sticking.
<br><br>我在尽量尝试
<br><br>I'm trying,
<br><br>但是我得不到你的任何反应
<br><br>but I'm not getting any traction here.
<br><br>就像我在跟你妈说话一样
<br><br>It's like I'm talking to your mom.
<br><br>我没关系啦 爸
<br><br>It's all right, Dad.
<br><br>我也没那么伤心
<br><br>I'm really not that upset.
<br><br>我知道你是什么样的人
<br><br>I know that's just how you are.
<br><br>在我的家庭里
<br><br>Look, growing up in my family,
<br><br>我们过生日或节日的的时候不互相祝福 或者你懂的
<br><br>we didn't, you know, talk or, you know, express things
<br><br>也不表达情感之类的...
<br><br>on birthdays or holidays or...
<br><br>即使我妈妈去世的时候
<br><br>Even when my Mom died,
<br><br>有一天我结束了篮球训练回到家
<br><br>I came home from basketball practice one day,
<br><br>然后我爸说 "你妈妈去世了"
<br><br>and my dad said, "Your mom passed."
<br><br>然后他就让我去写作业了
<br><br>Then he told me to go do my homework.
<br><br>第二天早上 我照样去上学
<br><br>The next morning, I went to school.
<br><br>我们以后也没再谈起这件事
<br><br>We never talked about it again.
<br><br>真的吗?
<br><br>Really?
<br><br>哦 我的天 好可怕
<br><br>Oh, my gosh, that's horrible.
<br><br>我们家就是这样的
<br><br>It's just the way it was.
<br><br>你并不是那样的
<br><br>Well, you're not like that, you know.
<br><br>你比爷爷好多了
<br><br>I mean, you're way better than Grandpa.
<br><br>当我想去抱他的时候 他就说
<br><br>When I try to hug him, he just says,
<br><br>"噢 你不会想抱一个老男人的"
<br><br>"Oh, you don't want to hug an old man."
<br><br>但是你一直容忍我给你的拥抱
<br><br>But you tolerate my hugs all the time.
<br><br>他关心你
<br><br>Well, he cares about you.
<br><br>他只是不擅长表达出来
<br><br>He's just not real comfortable saying it.
<br><br>我们都是这样 关心着你
<br><br>We all do. Care about you.
<br><br>我知道
<br><br>I know.
<br><br>我想问问 她怎么去世的?
<br><br>How did she die again?
<br><br>肺癌
<br><br>Lung cancer.
<br><br>她还很年轻 才四十二岁
<br><br>She was young, just 42.
<br><br>但是当她在家里跳舞时
<br><br>But the way she used to dance around the house,
<br><br>你会感觉她才二十岁
<br><br>you'd have thought she was 20.
<br><br>她总是唱歌 到处走动
<br><br>She was always singing, always moving.
<br><br>你可以想象她一边在洗碗槽旁洗盘子
<br><br>I can still see her at the kitchen sink
<br><br>一边哼着小曲的样子
<br><br>doing dishes and humming to herself.
<br><br>当我要在厨房玩儿的时候
<br><br>When I'd be playing in the kitchen,
<br><br>她会把我叫过去
<br><br>she'd call me over
